## Project Overview

This project involved taking over and continuing development of an internal ERP module for a logistics company. The system manages core operations such as income and expense tracking, inventory (stock-in and withdrawals), equipment usage, user accounts, and operational reports. It is customized to suit the company’s specific logistics workflow.

I enhanced the codebase by refactoring core modules and implementing new features to improve usability and maintainability. The system was deployed on a rented web hosting server and is used daily in real operations.
